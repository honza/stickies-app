# StickiesApp

This is a super-simple django application that sets as its aim to help with the
organization of software projects. 

### How it works

After logging into the application, you can view projects you are currently
working on. Each project has a separate page. The project page is divided into
the following sections:

* To do
* In progress
* Document
* Test
* Verify
* Done

When a task is first created, it should placed in the **To do** section. As the
project continues, you can drag it to the next section, etc. You can edit
existing tasks and delete them. Each notes knows who created it and when. All
changes are done asynchronously in the background.

### Set up

Easy! StickiesApp only depends on Django. Download, extract, sync your database
and run the server. That's it!

### Motivation

This projects removes the necessity to store tasks as sticky notes on the wall.
Programmers don't have to get up in order to access, read, modify their tasks.
Their tasks are now also available online so they can work from home.

### Contribute

All suggestions, feature requests and bug fixes are welcome. Submit a ticket,
fork your heart's content, and discuss the app on the wiki/issues.

### License

StickiesApp was started by Honza Pokorny in January 2011. The application is
available under the terms of the GPLv3 license. The terms of the lincese are
